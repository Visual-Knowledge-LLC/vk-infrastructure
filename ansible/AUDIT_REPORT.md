# Ansible Playbooks Audit Report
**Date**: September 19, 2025
**Auditor**: Infrastructure Team

## Executive Summary
Audit of Ansible playbooks in vk-infrastructure repository identified several critical security, operational, and architectural issues that require immediate attention.

## Critical Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)

### 1. deploy-slack-api-ec2.yml

#### ðŸ”´ Security Issues
- **SSH Key Exposure** (Lines 28-32): SSH commands use ProxyJump without key management
  - No SSH key path specified, relies on SSH agent
  - Keys could be exposed if agent forwarding is compromised

- **Docker Image Transfer via SCP** (Lines 27-32): Insecure and inefficient
  - Transfers unencrypted Docker images over SSH
  - Should use private ECR repository instead

- **Hardcoded Credentials** (Line 16): API keys in plain text
  - `SLACK_API_KEY` environment variable not properly managed

- **No Secret Management**: AWS credentials mounted as volumes (Line 56)
  - Mounts `~/.aws` directory into container
  - Should use IAM roles instead

#### ðŸŸ  Operational Issues
- **No Idempotency** (Lines 59-60): Always stops service even if not running
  - Uses `|| true` to ignore errors
  - Should check service state first

- **Manual nginx Configuration** (Lines 95-127): Complex sed operations
  - Error-prone string manipulation
  - Should use templates

- **No Rollback Strategy**: No way to revert failed deployments

- **Missing Health Checks** (Line 130): Only basic curl test
  - No comprehensive validation
  - No retry logic

#### ðŸŸ¡ Best Practice Violations
- **Localhost Execution** (Line 3): `hosts: localhost`
  - Executes on control machine, not managed nodes
  - Defeats purpose of Ansible inventory

- **Shell Module Overuse**: Entire deployment via shell commands
  - Should use Ansible modules (docker_image, docker_container, etc.)

- **No Error Handling**: No rescue blocks or error recovery

### 2. deploy-api.yml

#### ðŸ”´ Security Issues
- **Root Ownership Everything** (Lines 16-17, 25, 35, 55, 63):
  - All files owned by root
  - Service should run as non-privileged user

- **Missing Secrets Management**: No vault usage for sensitive data

#### ðŸŸ  Operational Issues
- **Hardcoded Paths** (Line 7-9):
  - Paths like `/home/ubuntu/data-uploader` hardcoded
  - Should be configurable variables

- **Dangerous Health Check** (Line 92):
  - Auto-restarts service every 2 minutes if down
  - Could mask underlying issues
  - No alerting before restart

- **Undefined Variable** (Line 75):
  - `health_check_file.stat.exists` never defined
  - Task will always skip

#### ðŸŸ¡ Best Practice Violations
- **No Inventory Management**: Assumes `api_server` host group exists
- **No Variable Files**: All variables inline
- **No Tags**: Can't run specific parts of playbook
- **No Validation**: No pre/post deployment checks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Implement Secrets Management**
   ```yaml
   - name: Retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
     aws_secret:
       name: vk-api-secrets
       region: us-west-1
     register: secrets
   ```

2. **Use Proper Ansible Modules**
   - Replace shell commands with docker_image, docker_container modules
   - Use template module for configuration files
   - Use systemd module consistently

3. **Add Security Hardening**
   ```yaml
   - name: Create service user
     user:
       name: vk-api
       system: yes
       shell: /bin/false
       home: /var/lib/vk-api
       create_home: yes
   ```

4. **Implement Proper Error Handling**
   ```yaml
   - block:
       - name: Deploy application
         # deployment tasks
     rescue:
       - name: Rollback on failure
         # rollback tasks
     always:
       - name: Notify deployment status
         # notification tasks
   ```

5. **Use Container Registry**
   - Push images to ECR
   - Use IAM roles for authentication
   - Implement image scanning

### Refactored Structure Recommendation

```
ansible/
â”œâ”€â”€ inventories/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ production/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hosts.yml
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ group_vars/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ staging/
â”œâ”€â”€ roles/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vk-api/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/main.yml
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ handlers/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ defaults/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vk-slack-api/
â”œâ”€â”€ playbooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ site.yml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ deploy.yml
â””â”€â”€ requirements.yml
```

### Security Checklist
- [ ] Remove all hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Implement AWS Secrets Manager or Ansible Vault
- [ ] Use IAM roles instead of API keys
- [ ] Run services as non-root users
- [ ] Implement proper firewall rules
- [ ] Add audit logging
- [ ] Use encrypted communication only
- [ ] Implement least privilege principle

### Operational Improvements
- [ ] Add comprehensive health checks
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployments
- [ ] Add rollback capabilities
- [ ] Create deployment pipelines
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement proper logging
- [ ] Add performance metrics

## Risk Assessment
**Current Risk Level: HIGH**

The playbooks in their current state present significant security risks:
- Credential exposure
- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- No audit trail
- No deployment validation

## Next Steps
1. Immediately remove hardcoded credentials
2. Refactor deploy-slack-api-ec2.yml to use proper Ansible modules
3. Implement ECR for Docker image management
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Create staging environment for validation

## Conclusion
Both playbooks require significant refactoring to meet production standards. The current implementation bypasses most of Ansible's benefits and introduces unnecessary security risks.

**Recommendation**: Pause production deployments until critical issues are addressed.
